# SubscriptionPlatform Smart Contract

## Vision

The **SubscriptionPlatform** smart contract provides a decentralized platform for managing recurring payments for subscription services. It allows service providers to set up subscriptions with fees and intervals, and users can make automatic payments based on the defined schedule.

## Features

- **Create Subscription**:
  - Service providers can set up subscription services with a specified fee and collection interval.
- **Collect Subscription Fees**:
  - The contract automates fee collection from subscribers, ensuring payments are made at regular intervals.

## Future Scope

1. **Automated Fee Collection**:

   - Implement automated fee collection based on blockchain timestamps to eliminate the need for manual checks.

2. **Multi-Subscription Management**:

   - Enable users to manage multiple subscriptions to different services on the platform.

3. **Notification System**:
   - Add functionality to notify users before a subscription fee is due or if a payment fails.

The **SubscriptionPlatform** contract simplifies recurring payments, providing a secure and transparent way for providers and users to manage subscription services in a decentralized ecosystem.
